/*********************************************************

   This is the code for a prototype MIDI field recorder
   that sits between a MIDI-OUT device (like a controller)
   and a MIDI-IN device (like a computer) for saving all
   note, pitch, and CC data that's being played without
   having any device specifically set to "record".
   
   This is Public Domain code, with all the caveats that
   comes with for you, because public domain is not the
   same as open source.
   
   See https://opensource.org/node/878 for more details.
   
   The reason this code is in the public domain is
   because anyone with half a brain and a need to 
   create this functionality will reasonably end up
   with code that's so similar as to effectively be
   the same as what has been written here.
   
   Having said that, there are countries that do not
   recognize the Public Domain. In those countries,
   this code is to be considered as being provided
   under an MIT license. See the end of this file
   for its full license text.
